## Overview

This is a Data Visualization project focusing on mapping all recent earthquakes using USGS GeoJSON data for earthquakes in the past 7 days.  The location and magnitude are represented in multiple ways to provide an ease of interpretation.  Size and color of circleMarkers represent magnitude.  Lat/lng coordinates and popup text reflect location.  Tectonic plate data from a GeoJSON file is also provided as a layer on the control panel to display their partitioning.  Three different types of maps are used from the Mapbox Styles API to provide options to the user.  Furthermore, all Major earthquakes > 4.5 magnitude are mapped as an independent layer to showcase the most impactful subset of data.  Unfortunately, the page is not active. For security reasons, I am witholding my api_key from publicity.
